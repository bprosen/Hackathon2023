# Hackathon 2023 Budget Manager

This is our 2023 Hackathon Project made on February 25th, 2023 by Ben Edgar-Prosen, Vansh Patel, Shiv Bhagat and Samvel Siby.

It is a fully working budget manager made with Android Studio and Java. It runs a local SQLite database and can track expenses, incomes and show statistics of each.
The only missing component we wanted to implement was showing a transaction history at the dashboard screen.

This project was made in around 9 hours of coding and learning Android Studio.
